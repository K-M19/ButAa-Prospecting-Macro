## ⚙️ Roblox Settings
- Roblox must be in windowed mode — fullscreen will cause 100% errors.
  >If you're in fullscreen and don't know how to switch to windowed mode, just press F11.

## ⚙️ Bloxstrap & Fishstrap & Client Settings

  >You can enable this option "Reset Everything to defaults".
- **Fast Flag Settings**
  >You can keep your own settings, but try not to change too much, especially font quality and image quality.
- **Roblox Default**
  >If you're using Roblox's default, you don't need changed anything.
  >But keep an eye on `ClientSettings/ClientAppSettings.json` — avoid tweaking too much, especially font quality and image quality.

> [!NOTE]
>  Stable FPS plays a very important role during macro operation. If your FPS drops while the macro is running, errors are 100% likely to occur, depending on the task the macro is performing.
Ideally, should maintain a stable 50–60 FPS for smooth operation.
  
> [!WARNING]  
> Works ideally only when using the following configuration: (Display: 1920x1080 & 100% Scale) (Roblox Font: Default) (Client Settings: Default).

## 🛠️ Display settings
- 1920 X 1080 (Recommended)
- 100% Scale (Need!!)

> [!NOTE] 
> The macro is designed to run at a resolution of 1920x1080 (16:9) with Scale (DPI) set to 100%. I cannot guarantee that it will function correctly at other resolutions.
